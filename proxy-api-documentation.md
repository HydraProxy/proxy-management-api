# HydraProxy API Documentation v1.0

### API General Usage Info

- **All POST digit parameters must be sent as **strings of digits** (NOT integers).**
- All requests must be sent via HTTPS
- API Key is included in the **Authorization** header with the format `Token api_token_string`
- **GET** or **POST** method must be specified. URLs for **POST** methods must end with a forward slash **/**
- The API recognizes requests sent only from whitelisted IP addresses (you can provide a maximum of three IP addresses from where the API will be called).
- Whitelisting an IP address is done manually. You can request a change at any time.
- All dates/hours/ timestamps are in UTC time.
- API responses are in json format.
- The first item of the response is the request status ("OK" or "ERROR").

**ERROR Response Example**

```
{  "status":"ERROR",
    "url" : "order_details/",
    "message":"unauthorised_request"
}
```

# How to use the API

### Required Headers

All API calls must include the following two headers.

```
'Accept: application/json'
'Authorization: Token extended_api_token_string'
```

1. [GET **get_account_info/**](#get_account_info)
2. [POST **view_usage_history/**](#view_usage_history)

---

## get_account_info/

Returns the details of your reseller account

**GET** ```https://app.hydraproxy.com/api/get_account_info/```

*Headers*
```
'Accept: application/json'
'Authorization: Token extended_api_token_string'
```

**Response**

```
{
    "status": "OK",
    "username": "acc_username",
    "email": "you@domain.com",
    "balance_usd": 180.0,
}
```


## view_usage_history/

**NOTE 1**: For current day usage history there is a delay in displaying the exact usage. Final usage for the day can be retrived at the end of day (UTC time).

**NOTE 2**: The History usage wonâ€™t be available for all the data set. An order's old history gets deleted to avoid large API responses, so you'll probably need to save it in the database. If you have opted for the extended usage log, you will be able to retrieve all your order's usage since extended usage activation.

**POST** ```https://app.hydraproxy.com/api/view_usage_history/```

*Headers*
```
'Accept: application/json'
'Authorization: Token extended_api_token_string'
```
*Accepted key:value Data*

| Key (low caps)  | Value Type (CAPS or digits)   | Options     | Description  |
| -------         | -------           | ---------------------   | -----------  |
| order_id        | digits            | 1 to XX | Insert the order ID as string. |
